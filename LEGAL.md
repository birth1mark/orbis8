# Legal Compliance, Ethics & Attribution Manifesto

**Orbis8** is an independent, non-commercial, open-source project created by **birth1mark** and the homebrew community. It is designed from the ground up to respect intellectual property, adhere to open-source licenses, and maintain complete compliance with homebrew distribution guidelines (including the PlayStation 4 Homebrew Store / PKG-Zone).

## 1. Clean-Room PS4 Development (No Sony SDK)

A critical requirement for legitimate homebrew on PlayStation 4 is that **no proprietary or leaked Sony Computer Entertainment / Sony Interactive Entertainment SDK code, headers, or libraries may ever be used**.

* **OpenOrbis Toolchain:** Orbis8 is built exclusively using the open-source [OpenOrbis PS4 Toolchain](https://github.com/OpenOrbis/OpenOrbis-PS4-Toolchain), which utilizes clean-room reverse-engineered headers, the open-source LLVM/Clang compiler targeting FreeBSD ELF (`x86_64-pc-freebsd-elf`), and community-implemented system wrappers.
* **No Decrypted Sony Firmware Files:** No proprietary keys, firmware modules, or copyrighted assets from Sony are packaged or distributed with Orbis8.
* **Target Audience:** Orbis8 is intended for users with legitimately purchased consoles running authorized homebrew-enabled firmware (e.g., GoldHEN on firmwares 5.05, 6.72, 9.00, or 11.00).

## 3. PICO-8 Trademarks & Fantasy Console Ethics

* **PICO-8** is a registered trademark of **Lexaloffle Games LLP** (created by Joseph White / *zep*).
* Orbis8 is **not** an official Lexaloffle product and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Lexaloffle Games.
* Orbis8 does not distribute the official PICO-8 binary, its proprietary built-in font ROM, or its development editor. It is an independent clean-room emulator that interprets community-created cartridges.

## 4. Lexaloffle BBS Public CDN & Network Etiquette

Orbis8 includes network capabilities to explore and download publicly shared cartridges from the official Lexaloffle Bulletin Board System (BBS). We strictly adhere to the following community standards:

1. **Public Sharing Purpose:** Cartridges posted to the Lexaloffle BBS under the Cartridges category are published by their creators specifically for public web play and community sharing.
2. **Transparent User-Agent:** All HTTP requests sent by Orbis8 explicitly identify themselves as:
   ```text
   User-Agent: Orbis8/1.0 (PS4 Homebrew by birth1mark)
   ```
3. **No Aggressive Scraping:** Cartridges are only fetched individually upon explicit user request. Orbis8 never mass-scrapes or floods the Lexaloffle servers.
4. **Local Persistent Caching:** Once a cartridge is downloaded, it is permanently cached to local storage (`/data/orbis8/carts/` on PS4 or `~/p8carts/` on PC), preventing redundant requests.
